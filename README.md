## who am i

I'm currently a software engineer on the infrastructure team at Apple, have been
since 2017. I wear many hats, but for the most part, I get to write code and 
solve unique problems.

I've been a software engineer for last twenty years but as you can see below, 
not an open source one. Someday that will change.

I use GitHub as a source of information but also to store my dotfiles and notes.
Unfortunately, all private.

## skills

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?logo=go&logoColor=white)

I've used Go nearly everyday since 2014, I started while I was working at Google 
and had the benefit of learning through code review from the Go team itself.
I became proficient enough to be a readability reviewer myself. I've mentored dozens
of engineers and have authored and maintained production services at Apple and 
Google scale.

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?logo=rust&logoColor=white)
![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/lua-%232C2D72.svg?logo=lua&logoColor=white)

I've been using Rust for the last couple of years and really like it. I'm becoming 
proficient and would like to increase my professional use of Rust. I also dabble 
in Neovim plugin development. 

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?logo=php&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

I wrote Python/PHP/Javascript for around twelve years, you remember LAMP don't you,
but stopped when my proficiency with Go surpassed them. I could get back in the 
saddle and pick them up quickly but would consider myself a beginner again.  A 
testament to "use it or lose it".

### about me
I was born in Asheville, NC and live in Austin, TX. I grew up as a nerd child of 
the 80-90s; comic books, Saturday morning X-Men, choose your own adventure books, 
Star Wars on VHS, Magic: The Gathering - you get the idea.  I have a wife and 
daughter who love me, a dog that likes me most of the time, and I try to stay fit. 

I'm living the dream.
